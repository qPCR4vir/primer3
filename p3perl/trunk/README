Primer3.pm development
====================

HOW TO BUILD

1. Make sure the necessary C code is in p3ccode/, for
   example:

   cd p3ccode
   cp ../../primer3/trunk/src/*.[ch] .  # Actually you do not need _all_ the files.


2. make clean
   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test


*** The makefiles do not track all dependencies.
If you are developing in this directory, always start
with

   make clean
