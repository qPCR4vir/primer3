        <p>Primer3 is a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=primer3&amp;start=0">widely used</a> program for designing PCR primers (PCR = "Polymerase Chain Reaction").  PCR is an essential and ubiquitous tool in genetics and molecular biology</a>.  Primer3 can also design hybridization probes and sequencing primers.</p>

		<p>PCR is used for many different goals.  Consequently, primer3 has many different input parameters that you control and that tell primer3 exactly what characteristics make good primers for your goals.</p>

		<p>Primer3 -- the C code, the web interface, and the documentation --  are an open source, community-development project hosted by <a href="http://sourceforge.net">SourceForge</a>.</p>
